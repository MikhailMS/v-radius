# V RADIUS
Pure (as far as this code goes) implementation of RADIUS in V


Rationale behind this project:
1. Want to practice new language and believe implementing RADIUS protocol is a good way to do so


## Testing
```
vlang dictionary_test.v

^^^ is a bit un-verbose, so I recommend following instead

vlang dictionary_test.v -stats
```

## Notes
1. Development is done against `V of version 0.4.2 9051ac8`
